    "Data Set Characteristics:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Number of Instances: 506 \n",
    "Number of Attributes: 13 numeric/categorical predictive\n",
    "Attribute Information (in order):\n",
    " * CRIM:     per capita crime rate by town\n",
    " * ZN:       proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.\n",
    " * INDUS:    proportion of non-retail business acres per town\n",
    " * CHAS:     Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)\n",
    " * NOX:      nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)\n",

    " * MEDV:     Median value of owner-occupied homes in 1000's\n",
    " * Missing Attribute Values: None\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Questions: \n",
    " - Using visual plots, explore the relationship between `MEDV` and other predictors.\n",
    " - Develop a regression model to **predict** `MEDV`. \n",
    " - Print out the results including the fitted parameters and model peformance metrics."
